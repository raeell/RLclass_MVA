    "But this is the XXIst century: most algorithms don't work in tabular form, data is abundant, neural networks (and other function approximators) are everywhere. So I made the deliberate choice **not** to write a class about TD-learning and Q-learning, but rather to discuss how one can implement approximate dynamic programming as a sequence of risk minimization problems, in its full generality. TD-learning and Q-learning are important landmarks in RL history. They help grasping intuitions and concepts. But they are also special cases of risk minimization applied to the dynamic programming sequence of functions arising from Bellman equations. So my belief is that a **modern** class on RL should not present them as independent algorithms but should rather fully set the stage they belong to, and only then do them historical justice by presenting them as the important milestones they are.

    "These three challenges are quite independent and we could study them in any order.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ideas we developped in this class relied on estimating value functions to deduce greedy policies. Finding such greedy policies was made easy because actions were discrete. But **finding improving policies** is actually a challenge in itself. This problem is present both when one searches for a greedy action with respect to $Q$, and when one directly aims at solving the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem without going through the proxy of the optimality equation. Chapter 5 will take us towards the realm of continuous actions in AVI. Chapter 6 will tackle direct policy search and resolution of the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem, notably through policy gradient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior policies are a cornerstone of RL: which action should one take to obtain informative samples? Should one explore uniformly the environment or rather follow a policy that takes the system towards promising states before exploring more agressively? This is called the **tradeoff between exploration and exploitation**. Chapters 7 and 8 will be dedicated to properly studying this tradeoff through the theory of stochastic bandits, which leads to the UCT and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms that are at the root of [alphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) and the subsequent alphaZero algorithms.  \n",

The stochastic behavior policy is provided through a `beta` array of size $|S|\\times |A|$ indicating the probability of picking each action in each state. To keep things simple, use a constant learning rate $\\alpha$. Add an option for providing the true $Q$ function and monitoring the error along training.

This is unfortunate and sometimes confusing. The actor-critic *algorithm* indeed uses and actor-critic *architecture* (a policy and a value function), but all algorithms we have seen so far, which all can be cast with an actor-critic architecture, are not necessarily actor-critic *algorithms* (actually none of them is). Even worse: in the recent literature, a very successful deep RL algorithm was called *soft actor-critic* (SAC - which will be studied it in a future chapter). But SAC, even though it uses an actor-critic architecture, does not rely on the policy gradient theorem and is not an actor-critic algorithm (it is an approximate value iteration one). Conversely, yet another modern deep RL algorithm called *advantage actor-critic* (A2C), is indeed an actor-critic algorithm, using an actor-critic architecture.   \n",

Nowadays, most people refer to algorithms that store a value function and a policy as actor-critic, in contradiction with the historical origin of the actor-critic algorithm.

    "The same remark applies to $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategies that often start with $\\epsilon=1$ and let it slowly decrease towards zero. These strategies don't account for the actual *visitation frequencies* of state-action pairs. In some states it might be good to keep a strong exploration probability because they actually have been seldom visited, while in other states, a faster decrease is desirable. This links also to the question of *value propagation* that was underpinned by the exercises on asynchronous value iteration in the previous chapter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The point here is to notice that $\\epsilon$-greedy is a simple, very naive exploration strategy that fits within the GLIE requirements but that much better exploration policies are possible by taking the current state into account (contextual exploration) or by using the values of the temporal difference (prioritized sweeping) and the $Q$ estimate (Boltzmann policies, $E^3$, $R_{max}$ or UCBVI strategies) for instance. These topics will be covered in the chapters dedicated to the exploration versus exploitation tradeoff."
