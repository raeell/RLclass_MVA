    "Still, we are dependent on a characterization of $\\pi^*$ that relies on the knowledge of the MDP.\n",

If such samples can be obtained from interaction with the system to control, it might be possible to learn $Q^*$ without knowing the MDP: that's where we really start talking about *reinforcement learning*."

Actually, the contraction property of $T^*$ insures that the stationary policy $\\pi'$ that is greedy with respect to $Q^\\pi$ is at least as good as $\\pi$, that is $V^{\\pi'}\\geq V^\\pi$. Consequently, the sequence of policies defined by $\\pi_{n+1}(s) = \\arg\\max_{a\\in A} Q^{\\pi_n}(s,a)$ has a monotonically improving corresponding sequence of value functions $V^{\\pi_n}$ and converges to $\\pi^*$.  \n",
